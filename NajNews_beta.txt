        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hey there! My name is <strong>Najee Nichols</strong>, and I’m currently a student at <strong>CHSAS</strong>. I guess you could say that I’m at that point in life where everything feels a little uncertain, but also really exciting. I’m still figuring out exactly who I am and what I want to do with my life, but I think that’s part of what makes this time so interesting.</p>

        <p>First off, I should probably tell you a little bit about where I’m from. I grew up in <strong>Chicago</strong>,big-city energy and neighborhood charm that makes it feel both exciting and homey at the same time.  But what really makes Chicago special is how it feels. In the summer, the whole city comes alive. People are out riding bikes along the Lakefront Trail, playing volleyball at North Avenue Beach, or grabbing food at one of the many street festivals. However the winter can be quite harsh.  The wind is brutal, the snow piles up, and you can’t step outside without layers, but somehow, it still feels magical especially when the Christmas lights go up downtown. 
             Chicago is a  also foodie paradise. First, there’s deep-dish pizza, and let me tell you, it’s not just pizza—it’s a whole experience. It’s thick, cheesy, saucy, and basically a pie of deliciousness. Lou Malnati’s and Giordano’s are the best in my opinion, and people will literally argue for hours about which one is better. Then, there’s the Chicago-style hot dog: an all-beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun, loaded with mustard, onions, neon-green relish, sport peppers, a pickle spear, tomato slices, and a dash of celery salt oh, and never ketchup. If you ask for ketchup, you’ll definitely get some side eye from a true Chicagoan. You can also get anything from authentic Mexican tacos in Pilsen to amazing Korean BBQ in Albany Park or some of the best soul food on the South Side. Every neighborhood has its own thing, which makes food in Chicago an adventure.

The environment here is just as diverse as the food. Each part of the city has its own vibe. Downtown, or "The Loop," is all about business and tourists, with Millennium Park, the Bean, and crazy traffic. Head north, and you’ll find places like Lincoln Park, where there are tree-lined streets, cozy cafés, and the free Lincoln Park Zoo. The West Side has a more artsy and creative feel, with cool coffee shops and murals everywhere, while the South Side is rich with history, music, and some of the city’s best local food spots. The people here are just as diverse as the neighborhoods. You’ll meet people from literally every background, which makes life here feel like a giant mix of cultures, languages, and traditions all blending together.

Overall, Chicago is a city that keeps you on your toes. It’s fast-paced, full of life, and packed with things to do, but it also has these little moments of calm like watching the sunset over the skyline or walking by the lake on a quiet morning. It’s got its rough spots, like any big city, but at the end of the day, there’s no place like it.</p>

        <p>I guess you could call me a bit of a mix when it comes to my interests. I’m a little bit of a nerd, ans also a big gamer but I also love being outdoors and staying active. During the week, I’m usually buried in assignments or projects for my classes.  I’ve always had an interest in <strong>d= helping people</strong>, and I find it fascinating how it can impact so many different parts of our lives just talking to someone for an hour can can relly help. At the same time, I’m also learning how to balance that with other parts of life, like keeping up with friends, staying healthy, and also finding time to relax.</p>

      

        <p>One of the things that keeps me going is my passion for making a difference. Whether it’s through my hobbies, or just the little things I do every day, I want to contribute in a way that matters. I’ve always had an interest in helping others, whether it’s tutoring a classmate or volunteering for a local cause. It’s something that gives me purpose. I know I’m still young and I have a lot to learn, but I really believe that if you can make someone’s day a little easier or brighter, you’re already making an impact.</p>

        <p>Another thing I’m passionate about is personal growth. I’m the kind of person who likes to push myself outside of my comfort zone and take on new challenges. Whether it’s speaking in front of a large group or trying something completely out of my wheelhouse, I love finding opportunities to grow and stretch myself. I think that’s one of the most important things you can do in college—you’re constantly learning not just about the world around you, but also about yourself. You learn your strengths, your weaknesses, and most importantly, how to persevere through the ups and downs.</p>

        
        <p>Looking ahead, I’m excited for what the future holds. I have no idea what’s going to happen, but I’m ready for whatever comes next. College is just one chapter, and I know that there’s a lot more to come after it. I hope to continue learning, experiencing new things, and growing as a person. Whether that’s through my career, relationships, or personal passions, I’m committed to living life with intention and purpose.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I want to look back on this time in my life and know that I gave it my all. I want to be proud of who I am, what I’ve accomplished, and the positive impact I’ve made on others. The journey is still unfolding, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a little more about me. I’m looking forward to all the adventures ahead, and I can’t wait to see what comes next!</p>

        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to reshape various sectors in the United States, prompting both innovation and concern.</strong></p>
        <p>Recent developments underscore AI's expanding role and the challenges accompanying its integration into American society.</p>

        <h2>Government Oversight Intensifies Amid AI Integration</h2>
        March 12, 2025
        <p>Federal agencies are under increased scrutiny regarding their use of AI technologies. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have initiated inquiries into the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) deployment of AI tools, expressing concerns over legal compliance and data protection. The committee highlights the necessity for adherence to standards such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program and the Advancing American AI Act. There is particular apprehension about the use of proprietary AI systems like GSAi and potential implications for data security, especially given DOGE's rapid and opaque operations. This scrutiny coincides with workforce reductions in federal agencies, including significant layoffs in the Department of Education. Lawmakers stress the importance of clear objectives, robust safeguards, and transparency in AI applications to mitigate potential risks.</p>

        <h2>State-Level Initiatives Address AI Ethics and Transparency</h2>
             March 12, 2025
        <p>At the state level, legislators are proactively seeking to regulate AI usage to ensure ethical standards. In Connecticut, State Representative Hubert Delany has introduced Senate Bill 2, titled "An Act Concerning Artificial Intelligence." The bill aims to enforce regulations that guarantee AI systems are fair, accountable, and transparent. Key provisions include mandating human oversight in AI decision-making processes to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws and requiring individuals to be informed when AI is used in decisions affecting their lives, such as employment, financial services, and education. The legislation also proposes labeling AI-generated content and criminalizing the malicious use of AI technologies, such as deepfakes, to prevent misinformation and protect individual reputations. These measures reflect a growing commitment to balancing technological innovation with ethical considerations and public protection.</p>

        <h2>Educational Institutions Grapple with AI Surveillance and Student Privacy</h2>
             March 12, 2025
        <p>Educational institutions across the U.S. are increasingly adopting AI-powered surveillance tools to monitor students' online activities, aiming to prevent violence and address mental health concerns. For example, Vancouver Public Schools in Washington have implemented software like Gaggle to flag potential issues such as bullying or self-harm. However, investigations have revealed significant privacy and security risks, including incidents where sensitive student documents were inadvertently exposed. These findings have raised alarms about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the potential erosion of trust between students and school administrations. While AI surveillance offers the promise of early intervention, questions persist regarding its effectiveness in enhancing safety and supporting student well-being, as well as the long-term implications for student privacy and institutional transparency.</p>

        <h2>Economic Dynamics Shift as Tech Giants Explore AI Manufacturing Partnerships</h2>
             March 12, 2025
        <p>In the corporate sector, significant shifts are underway as major technology firms explore partnerships to bolster AI manufacturing capabilities. Intel's stock experienced a 5.5% surge, reaching $20.8 per share, following reports of discussions with companies like TSMC, Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom about operating Intel's chipmaking foundries. These talks, still in early stages, propose that TSMC manage operations without exceeding a 50% ownership stake. This initiative aligns with presidential requests for TSMC to support Intel's struggling business, highlighting the strategic importance of AI hardware manufacturing. Intel's recent challenges, including a 56% stock decline over the past year and $18.8 billion in net losses in 2024, underscore the competitive pressures in the AI industry. The interest from other chipmakers suggests a potential turning point for Intel, with broader implications for the U.S. technology sector's competitiveness in the global AI arena.</p>

        <h2>Educational Trends Reveal Growing AI Integration Amidst Student Concerns</h2>
        <p>The integration of AI tools in education is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly among Generations Z and Alpha. A Pew Research Center study indicates that the use of AI for homework assistance among 13 to 17-year-olds has doubled from 13% to 26% over the past two years. Despite this trend, many students express a preference for traditional study methods, citing concerns about misinformation and academic integrity. Educators acknowledge these concerns, attributing declining literacy rates more to budget constraints than AI usage. However, some districts have responded by banning AI tools in schools, reflecting a tension between technological advancement and educational values. Students remain actively engaged in extracurricular activities, suggesting a balanced approach to technology integration is essential to preserve critical thinking and learning skills.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These developments highlight the multifaceted impact of AI on American society, encompassing governance, legislation, education, and the economy. As AI technologies continue to evolve, a concerted effort to address ethical, legal, and societal challenges will be crucial to harness their benefits while mitigating potential risks.</p>
